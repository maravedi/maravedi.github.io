# About Me
I like to fiddle. In general, if I have to do a task and I anticipate having to repeat it, then I script it. I'm a Security Engineer and PowerShell junkie.

Some fun things I like doing:
* Security-related:
  * Scripting (PowerShell, Bash, Python)
  * Reversing firmware
  * Bug hunting
  
* For fun:
  * Hockey
