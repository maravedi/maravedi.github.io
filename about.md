# About Me
My name is David and I like to fiddle. In general, if I have to do a task and I anticpate having to repeat it, then I script it. I'm a PowerShell enthusiast, and I enjoy building my skillset in the realms of automation, web development, security, and systems administration.

I imagine a world where code runs all infrastructures through desired state configuration and container orchestration.
